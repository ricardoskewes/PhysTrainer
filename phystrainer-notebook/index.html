# Phystrainer Notebooks
Phystrainer notebooks take inspiration from Jupyter Notebooks to provide flexibility when reading and writing problems in Phystrainer. There are two types of cells:
* Markdown/Text 
* Question/Input

_Hint: Double click any of the cells to begin editing. Double click outside to exit edit mode._
> Important: Only Markdown cells are currently available. Question cells are still under development.

                {
                        "description": "E.g., write down EulerÂ´s identity", 
                        "type": "PTQuestion.math"
                }
        </pt-notebook-cell-question>
        <pt-notebook-cell-markdown>
## Data structure
Cells inside a notebook have the following structure
```js
{
        "type": "markdown", // markdown, question.text, question.datapoints, question.multiplechoice, 
        "protected": true,  // Whether other users can edit or view the cell's raw content
        "content": "...", // Raw content of the cell (custom question JSON for questions, and raw string for markdown)
        "id": 3, // Id of the cell in database
}
```
### Markdown cells
Content in markdown cells is stored as a raw string. 

### Question Cells
Content in question cells is stored as a [**PTQuestion**](./question/README.md) object

## Known bugs
- HTML tags are not rendered inside markdown cells
- Edit mode does not initially appear in the correct height
- $\KaTeX$ is not rendered correctly
- Quotation marks are not escaped correctly
- Questions edit mode does not reflect question's settings

        <pt-notebook-cell-markdown>
## Further development
- Continue development on questions edit-mode/output
- Define styles for inputs on questions
- Allow to reorder cells
- Allow to insert cells at a given position
- Add buttons/visual cues for reordering, editing, deleting
- Lots of testing
